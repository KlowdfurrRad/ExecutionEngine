## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Market Data Latency**: Implement local caching and optimized WebSocket handling
2. **Exchange Connectivity Issues**: Build redundant connections and failover mechanisms
3. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Continuous profiling and optimization throughout development
4. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular security audits and penetration testing

### Business Risks
1. **Regulatory Compliance**: Consult with compliance team throughout development
2. **Market Volatility**: Build robust risk management controls
3. **Data Accuracy**: Implement multiple data validation layers
4. **Operational Risk**: Comprehensive testing and rollback procedures

### Contingency Plans
- **Week 4 Delay**: Extend Phase 1 by 1 week, adjust subsequent phases
- **Week 8 Delay**: Critical milestone - consider additional resources
- **Technology Issues**: Have backup technology choices ready (e.g., Node.js as C++ alternative)
- **Resource Constraints**: Identify external contractors for specific components

This roadmap prioritizes your core requirements while building a scalable foundation for future enhancements. The focus on options trading UI and pricing comparison in Phase 2 aligns with your stated priorities.
