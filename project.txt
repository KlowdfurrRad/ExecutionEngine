This File contains notes taken down regarding the project.

options trader, our own fund, low MFT, 

execution platform, 

1st user front : Vue.js , backend: C++
check pricing and hosting on cloud

baskets, NIFTY50 basket weightage of 50 stocks
ticker + weightages + expiry + options onto excel

inputs: 100 crores; list of tickers, long short for each, weightages, based on the CMP;
outputs : quantities for each stocks; simple rounding
for each row ; columns: price, quantity, type of ticker, expiry of future (if future), volume and open interest. the quantity should not exceed 5% of last 30 days avg volume and open interest.

Cash prices: compare spot prices NSE and BSE
check if we want to go for the current/next month future or current equity cash. 

Note: current future price - 100.4 ; fair value-100.5; 2nd month fair value = 101 ; 2nd month future = 100.9; then percentage 0.1/101 is smaller; hence 1st month. 3 months; 

- Only check NSE futures, coz more liquid. between cash check BSE and NSE. If liquidity does not hold for it then move to 2nd cheapest.
- We can only buy lots in futures so, for 64285 at lots of 500; we buy 285 in cash/equity.
- Execution should comply the exchange rules, and executed in slice manner, and in certain ratios.
- How much margin is required to enter the trade.
- Add a total market value watcher and under conditions some and/or/not send the orders. If some criteria is hit we directly execute the trade. Need a parser if complex conditions.
((x>20)||(y <50)) && 
- Exchanges have rules like number of stocks per order, etc.
- Always be a market order not limit order.

=======================================================

2nd UI
- On some tickers : options, prices and quantities gives total market value. Ratios of each set and overall quantity. 2 legs of NIFTY 1500*price and strike. 
so for total market value buy some sets at some limit and sell at a later limit add stop loss.

=======================================================

Palwe was saying GoLang is used for backend.

=======================================================

Questions: 
What kind of app we building; standalone on 1 machine; backend on cloud always running/frontend with authorization??
Are we only working live or any kind of historical also needed?
If we do not need a lot of data then within application is fine, Otherwise might need database?

Database choice:
redis?, postgres? clickhouse? Access?
Store basket information (name of stocks, weightages, sell/buy)
Current portfolio held

Backend : finalized C++ ; 
What all to build :
Inputs from frontend
Data reading from vendors (Zerodha), database/in memory

API for contacting and making trades Zerodha.

Comparison logic among stock types. - Pricing Module

Conditional logic we need to build.

Frontend:
Display on Frontend

Abhishek 03/10/2025

Take second by second data for options.
Price options 

=====================================================

For us:
Cash & futures
Options Chain

He has been trading options for the last 5 years. Couple of 100 crores.
He has collaborated with large hedge fund of 4-5 billion dollars. They are into equity options. They are not present in India.
He has pitched to them to come to India but they are sus because 

Build watertight algorithm. Should be able to connect with other pricing models.
Want to place order to multiple brokers -> Should allow placing orders on multiple brokers.
He wants to get other people from departments such as math etc.
Would later send this to people from CMU so that to test and fine-tune.

=====

Algorithm Execution 1:
NIFTY gives weightage every morning.
Weightage will be entered by me in the morning.
Choose between current and next month future. Only look at NSE futures. NSE cash equity vs NSE current month future vs NSE next month future.
Need to do DCF etc.
Also checks whether BSE or NSE cash equity is lower.
Also checks liquidity , not more than 5% of day.

Before executing trade, show the list of trades that will be done. Total market value.
Other point you need to note: Not trading 0dte.

There should be an option to execute at limit -> Should show the market value after slippage.

If I want to enter options, I can also add OPTION TICKER, EXPIRY etc. Suppose to hedge the investment.

He says the execution part is the most complicated.

=====

Abhishek has Philips capital, Motilal, AXIS.

=====

Discussion regarding limits on zerodha etc.
Don't rely on zerodha.

As per our rules, need to figure out decent ratio to execute them at one time.
Challenges like: If balance remaining after buying futures, may need to do some cash equities.
If stuff not executed, should clean up.

=====

Second algorithm:
Extract options chain from zerodha. Such as NIFTY.
Display gamma, theta, delta. Calculated IV, and our calculated IV -> from our pricing software.
If we have any ideas or done research can implement ourselves also. He prefers this to be orthogonal to the other guy as if we collab with the quant fin guy then our ideas get biased.

Execution for options:
[Note: Historial data storage will not be done by us]
If I want to get into a six legged option combination, should show how much loss to slippage.

07/10/2025 Abhishek Visit, New info listed
- Wants multiple baskets on the UI.
- Will be hedging one basket with another. Other possibility it combine all tickers of main and hedge into one basket.
- Wants market value for both.
- Long NIFTY stock -> cash and future long, And short synthetic => display the market value
- TrueData around 1 lakh price. Provides index weightages from many exchanges , for example nifty weightage. This changes every day and released by the exchange.
- He has arista switch, top of the line. Not many companies that make these switches. Niche market.
- Another project:
    Will give data on many asset classes. For tickers in each asset class wants to provide some ui that shows stuff about possible opportunities.
    Correlation of ticker Open Close changes, if corr high and one day moves differently can profit.
    Can do something similar for vol and variance.
    Bloomberg data use for this. Can even talk with bloomberg people over call or they can send someone for us to ask doubts.
- We can only short stocks intraday in India. Must square off. Send a intimation to trader on UI to do so, or the broker may put a penalty. These penalties don't even show up in PnL, might show up in email or somewhere later.

29/10/2025 Some explanations of his excel sheet.
An Algorithm:
Spread between futures and stock over 24 months's 5 days.

Shared an excel sheet.
Divs: 23 (Tells how many dividends announced)
Mean, 1std dev below(Green). 1std dev above(Red). And then 3 std devs figures.
Future - Cash Absolute value
Call - Put value. Just above the ATM strike.
Previously NSE BSE, Now NSE Cash to NSE Future.
Divs: Divs Announced, Xdate(The date dividend is announced), BDVD(Bloomberg forecasted dividend)
What is div1 to div18 -> The dividends of 18 different stocks and dates announced in brackets.

If you look at the bottom you can open new tabs. Should be able to group tickers into sheets.
Wants same design as the excel sheet, want same colours as well.
Particular font called Lucida.
Should be able to move rows/ cols. Have multiple tabs.
Not only this, give some of your inputs as well.
He needs to give Bloomberg data.
